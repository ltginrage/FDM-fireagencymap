# FDM-fireagencymap
Map of current fire stations withtin USA. Currently I only have Alaska, Illinois, and Missouri on here. Still working out some errors in the .json

Please note: A majority (95%+) of the data in the data.json file was exported from OSM (OpenStreetMap) using Operpass Turbo API.

A small ammount of this data is turning out to be incorrect so if you see something that is incorrect, you cant contact me for editing access to the CSV (which I turn into a JSON) or commit to the JSON Directly. Preferrably if you added to the CSV so it dont accidently get deleted when I re-add the CSV data to the JSON.
